## How to play

Install and build

`nvm install`

`npm install`

`npm run build`

Start the server

`npm start`

Now open http://localhost:3000 in two different browsers or tabs. Enter your name and start playing.

Maximum two players can join a game. Game ends if any one player disconnects.


## Run in dev mode

If you want re-build as you make changes then run `npm run dev`, this will run the build, start the server and will keep watching files for any changes.

## What can be improved

- Add an option to play with a bot
- If two players already joined, start a new room where two more can join
- Add unit tests
